Hi! This is my cs2600 repo. This is used to store my working homework from the class.

Please, if you're a fellow student looking for code to plagiarize, I beg you to reconsider. There a plenty of online resources that you can utilize. 
I recommended checking out the reference libraries for Java, C++, and Python. 
If I find out that my code has been plagiarized, I will have to make this repo private.
